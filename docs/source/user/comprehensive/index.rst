In-depth user guide
===================

Welcome to the in-depth documentation for the Quantum Development Kit (QDK) Chemistry library.
This documentation provides detailed information about QDK/Chemistry's structure, components, and usage patterns.

The QDK/Chemistry library is designed to facilitate quantum chemistry calculations and simulations.
It provides a set of tools and libraries for working with molecular structures, performing electronic structure calculations, analyzing quantum many-body systems, and running calculations on quantum hardware or simulators.

QDK/Chemistry features a unified interface for communitry quantum chemistry software packages, allowing seamless interoperability with established software while maintaining a consistent API.
This enables users to leverage specialized capabilities across different packages without changing their workflow.
