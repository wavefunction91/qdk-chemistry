class AlgorithmFactory(ABC):
    """Base class for algorithm factories in QDK/Chemistry.

    Algorithm factories are responsible for creating and managing algorithm instances
    of a specific type. Each factory maintains a registry of algorithm implementations
    that can be instantiated by name. Factories handle both built-in C++ implementations
    and custom Python implementations.

    The factory pattern allows for dynamic algorithm selection at runtime and provides
    a centralized mechanism for registering and discovering available implementations.

    Note:
        This class is typically not used directly by end users. Instead, use the
        higher-level registry functions in `qdk_chemistry.algorithms` for
        creating and registering algorithms.

    Examples:
        Creating a custom factory for a new algorithm type:

        >>> from qdk_chemistry.algorithms.base import AlgorithmFactory, Algorithm
        >>> import qdk_chemistry.algorithms.registry as registry
        >>> import qdk_chemistry.algorithms as algorithms
        >>> from qdk_chemistry.data import Structure

        ...     def type_name(self) -> str:
        ...         return "geometry_optimizer"
        >>>
        >>> # Example factory for this algorithm type
        >>> class GeometryOptimizerFactory(AlgorithmFactory):
        ...     def algorithm_type_name(self) -> str:
        ...         return "geometry_optimizer"
        ...
        ...     def default_algorithm_name(self) -> str:
        ...         return "bfgs"  # Default algorithm
        >>>
        >>> # Register a custom implementation
        >>> class BfgsOptimizer(GeometryOptimizer):
        ...     def name(self) -> str:
        ...         return "bfgs"
        ...     def _run_impl(self, structure: Structure):
